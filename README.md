# odin-recipes
This is my recipes project from The Odin Project. Bare-bones as it is, it's great for a HTML refresher. 

STILL TO DO
- tofu curry page isn't loading from link on index page, otherwise works fine 


LEARNING POINTS: 

- basic boilerplate of a HTML page 
The DOCTYPE declaration, the HTML element, lang attribute, head element, meta element, title element, body element.

- working with text
Paragraphs, headings, strong element, emphasis element.

- nesting and indentation between elements
Indent children by two spaces. Parent, child and sibling relationships between elements will become more important later when start styling HTML with CSS and adding behaviour with JavaScript. 

- HTML comments 

- lists 
Unordered lists, ordered lists. 

- images
Image element. Also best practices with alt attribute and image size attributes. 

- absolute and relative links
Anchor elements for both. Absolute for pages on other websites, relative for own websites. 

Relative, usually safe in going ./ 
Go up a level with another dot. 

Best practice includes noopener and noreferrer value for security reasons as well as target to _blank value for opening in new tab.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A shockingly rich and filling tofu curry that
      just so happens to be vegan. While the curry simmers, the 
      roti will take just ten minutes.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>400g firm tofu</li>
        <li>Two tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>Four tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Five tbsp tikka/madras paste</li>
        <li>Two white onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>One tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>500g tomato passata</li>
        <li>200g creamed coconut</li>
        <li>15g coriander, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>100g plain or wholemeal flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>One tsp vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Drain the tofu
        on kitchen paper and slice in half horizontally, patting
        it as you go to absorb as much moisture as possible. Tear 
        the tofu into chunks, tip into a bowl and toss to coat
        in the cornflour, 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil and 0,5
        tsp salt. Spread out on a baking sheet and bake
        in the oven for 25 mins.</li>
        <li>Using the same bowl, make the roti. Mix the flour,
        a pinch of salt and the oil together with enough water
        (about 65ml) to make a soft, not sticky, dough. Knead on
        a floured surface for 3 mins, then cover and leave to rest
        while you make the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 3 tbsp oil in a frying pan 
        over a medium heat and cook the curry paste until 
        fragrant, about 1 min. Add the onions and cook for 4-5 mins,
        adding a splash of water if needed to prevent any sticking, 
        then cover and cook unti completely softened (about 8-10 minutes
        more),stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato purée, passata and a pinch of salt.
        Simmer for a further 5 mins before adding the creamed 
        coconut. Reduce the heat to low while you heat the roti. 
        Loosen the sauce occasionally with a splash of water if it's
        starting to look too thick.</li>
        <li>Divide the roti mixture into four equal balls.
        Roll the balls out on a floured surface using a floured
        rolling pin until  2-3mm thick. Heat a dry frying pan until
        very hot, then cook each roti for 1 min on each side until
        charred in places. Wrap in a tea towel as they come off the heat
        to keep them soft.</li>
      </ol>

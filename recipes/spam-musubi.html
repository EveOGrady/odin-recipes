      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Spam is an affordable protein option. Here is a 
      filling and nutritious meal using Spam, originating
      in Hawaii with a Japanese <em>onigiri</em> style.
      One of these works well for lunch - make a couple
      if you're thinking about having this for tea!</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nori sheet</li>
        <li>Spam</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Cucumber and carrot</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Chopping board time - cut up your cucumber length
        wise, grate your carrot and slice your Spam into roughly
        six pieces. Only two slices will fit into one musubi, most
        likely, but you can refridgerate the rest! Take out your
        nori sheet and put the veggies on there.</li>
        <li>Fry your spam for about 2-3 minutes on each side,
        until they are both lightly crisped. You don't need to
        worry about using any oil but marinating in teriyaki can
        add a lot of flavour! Pop the slices on your nori. </li>
        <li>Boil your rice over high heat or microwave then
        place on your nori.</li>
        <li>Time to scramble! Combine an egg and milk in a
        mixing bowl with a whisk and add in a pinch of salt
        and pepper. Once it has gone yellow, melt butter 
        in your pan. You're going to want to keep your 
        temperature on the low side of medium as you add your
        egg mixture. Use a rubber spatula to stir the eggs,
        scraping the bottom of the pan with each motion.</li>
        <li>Once you've put your scrambled eggs in your nori,
        roll everything up. Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
